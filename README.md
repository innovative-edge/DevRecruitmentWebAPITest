Brief

A junior member of your team has built a Web API contacts service. You have been asked to review and re-factor their code, see the attached DevRecuitmentWebAPITest Visual Studio 2019 project. All the code is in in the one file named ContactsController.cs. Refactor the code in this file ensuring it follows the SOLID principles and good coding practices. The re-factored code must be structured so in the future Unit Tests may be built to test functionality.  You may and new folders, files and even projects.

Please note a data source for the contacts and users has not been included, as it is not needed for this test.
